Different methods/formats for config                                                                                                                                      
Tested configuration of fabric with segment routing 

Test ONOS with software switches (OVS)                                                                                                                                    
Tested ONOS configuration with OVS bridges                                                                                                                                
Looked into segment routing source code                                                                                                                                   
Looked into some of new features of CORD 2.0 and will continue next week
