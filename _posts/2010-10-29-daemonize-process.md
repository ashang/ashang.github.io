Description: turns other processes into daemons
 There are many tasks that need to be performed to correctly set up a
 daemon process. This can be tedious. Daemon performs these tasks for
 other processes. This is useful for writing daemons in languages other
 than C, C++ or Perl (e.g. /bin/sh, Java).
 .
 If you want to write daemons in languages that can link against C functions
 (e.g. C, C++), see libslack which contains the core functionality of daemon.
