## Upstart jobs cannot be run in a chroot

 Upstart  jobs cannot be started in a chroot because upstart acts as a service  supervisor, and processes within the chroot are unable to communicate  with the upstart running outside of the chroot ([430224](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/430224)).   This will cause some packages that have been converted to use upstart  jobs instead of init scripts to fail to upgrade within a chroot.  Users  are advised to configure their chroots with /sbin/initctl pointing to  /bin/true  
  
  
[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/upstart/+bug/430224](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/upstart/+bug/430224)  
  
Replacing /sbin/initctl with a symlink to /bin/true is a fairly standard  
 way to disable services in a chroot
