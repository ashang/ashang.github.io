radius is UDP, so need re-transmit attempts, time-outs to compensate for best-effort transport,   
  
tacacs+ is TCP,   
  
- ACK within network round-trip time, i.e., RTT, regardless how loaded and slow the backend auth mechanism might be  
- immediate indication of crashed, or not running, server by a reset RST;  
    UDP cannot tell the diff between a server that is down, slow, or non-existent   
- TCP keepalive, server crashes can be detected out-of-band with actual requests; can maintain multiple server connections simultaneously.  
  
  
  
  
Pakcet encryption  
  
radius only encrypts pass in the access-request packet, from client to server,   
  
tacacs+ has header field to indicate whether the body is encrypted or not  
  
  
  
  
  
radius combines authentication and authorization,   
  
  
tacacs+ separates AAA. can use kerberos to do authentication,   
  
  
permission granted upon particular com,and
