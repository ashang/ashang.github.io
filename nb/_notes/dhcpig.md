dhcpig is a DHCP exhaustion script using scapy network library

DHCPig initiates an advanced DHCP exhaustion attack. It will consume all IPs
on the LAN, stop new users from obtaining IPs, release any IPs in use, then
for good measure send gratuitous ARP and knock all windows hosts offline.

It is based on the scapy library and requests admin privileges to execute.
It has been tested on multiple Linux distributions and multiple DHCP servers
(ISC, Windows 2k3/2k8,..).
